                        The statues of the Garden represent, according to the archive document found by Daniele 
                        Santambrogio ', characters of Greek-Roman mythology and sixteenth-century literature, whose 
                        events suggest that they were chosen by the client on the basis of a specific pedagogical-moral 
                        intent: it is necessary to escape from vice and instead follow the path of virtue. We do not know 
                        if the current layout of the entire complex corresponds to the original project, 
                        but it is understood that some statues are currently placed out of place.

            <p>
                In the south-east corner of the Palace, the headless statue, in poor condition, seems to represent the Spring, since under the right arm you can still see the one
                which looks like a basket of flowers. At the north-east corner, the Statue of Circe. Both are not in the right place, you will understand later why Turning your back to the Palace,
                on the south side you can see what could be the statue of Venus, at her feet, among other things, are sculpted flowers that look like dog roses, like those held by the
                famous Venus of Urbino by Titian. On the north side the statue of Autumn. It is understood that the statue of Spring should be in place of that of Venus,
                since in the area of ​​the Baroque Fountain, in correspondence with this statue there is that of Summer and once there was also that of Winter, corresponding to the
                statue of Autumn: the four seasons, which mark the passing of our existence.
                Continuing, always on the south side, you can see the statues of Ruggero and the sorceress Alcina, two characters from the Orlando Furioso by L. Ariosto.
                On the north side the statue of Ulysses; we understand that, by analogy with the previous couple, Circe had to stand before Ulysses,
                while now there is the statue of the Syringe.
                Returning along the south side, you can see two other statues, that of the Glory and, opposite, that of Eurystheus, the king who subjected Hercules to the twelve labors.
                In correspondence with these last two statues, on the opposite side, there were two more.
                Continuing on, we come across a male statue trampling on a boar's head: it is the statue of the Hunter. In it it seems to be able to recognize the handsome Meleager,
                Greek hero, son of the king of Calidon, Eneo, and Altea.
                Continuing further, on the north side, an imposing statue immediately appears, that of Hercules, mythical hero, famous not only
                because of his physical strength, but also because a young man, finding himself having to choose whether to follow the path of vice or that of virtue, he chose virtue!
                In correspondence with Hercules, along the opposite side, the equally imposing statue of which we all recognize
                the attributes of the god Apollo: the sun disk on the breastplate, the bow and quiver on the back and a lyre.
                Continuing the journey, always on the south side,at the edge of the small lake attached to the Baroque Fountain, we come to the statue of Valor, a soldier, who holds a book in his left hand, while his right hand holds a sword.
                This statue is faced, albeit at a certain distance, by the statue of a female figure, who wears a laurel wreath on her head, her right arm raised.
                with his hand in the act of rejecting someone, while wearing a bracelet on his left arm: Daphne.
                On the opposite side to that of the Value, there is the statue of a woman with bare breasts,
                in the act of combing! And Lascivia. In front of it, always at a certain distance, the statue of another woman with bare breasts, with her hair tied up, posing in a
                welcoming attitude This time it is about Clizia.
                Continuing along the south side, on the side of the Baroque Fountain, you can see a statue in a bad state of conservation! She carries a sheaf of wheat in her arms,
                it is in line with the statue that is in place of Spring, at the beginning of the garden, it is Summer. Next to it a statue with the still legible inscription:
                Locio or L'Ozio. Even at the time these statues were placed, summer was supposed to be a time of rest for some! On the opposite side, a headless statue,
                with the clearly legible inscription: Fatigue. The statue that was next to her, unfortunately, is no longer there, but it represented Winter.
                The statues of the four seasons
                probably represent the continuous cycle of human existence and contain the parable of life: man, called to live pursuing the moral good,
                virtue, can be hindered by the rise of various passions and fall prey to the vices that would distract him from his purpose. Even prominent figures, such as
                Hercules, who was subjected to Onfale, may be wrong, but thanks to Repentance, there is the possibility of resuming the interrupted path. The fullness of life does not
                it is reached by indulging in corrupting vices and passions, the fruit of blind selfishness, but by pursuing a morally upright and virtuous existence, following the luminous path of good.
                This interpretation under the banner of moral training is supported by a notation present in the testament of Bartolomeo III Arese, where,
                urging his wife Lucrezia and daughter Giulia to take the utmost care of the Palazzo di Cesano and the Garden, he stated: I want them to enjoy the beauty of
                this palace and garden to cheer up souls and keep them away from vices, and that there they can enjoy themselves with friends and relatives, always remembering that all things
                humans are transient.

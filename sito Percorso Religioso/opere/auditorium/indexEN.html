                    The ancient building stands in front of the current Church of Santo Stefano, with the front facing the
                    square dedicated to Monsignor Arrigoni. Its original structure, dating back to the thirteenth century,
                    it had a different orientation, with the facade facing the river. This is proven
                    both from a map prior to the year of construction and from the position of the bell tower,
                    today not aligned with the building structure.
                    The main part, built in 1665 at the behest of Bartolomeo Arese, is characterized by the apse,
                    from the side sacristies and from large frescoed parts, such as the side chapels (from the workshop of the
                    Montalto) and the vault (decorated in the nineteenth century by Tagliaferri), while the part facing the
                    square is an extension of 1800, which added two bays to the previous building.
                    The ancient Church, deconsecrated in the 1920s, returned to new life at the beginning of 2008,
                    transformed into a modern multifunctional structure used as an auditorium (for concerts,
                    theatrical performances, exhibitions, etc.), named in memory of Paolo and Davide Disarò,
                    two young Cesanese brothers who disappeared on 19 July 1985 in the tragedy of the Val di Stava,
                    where they did voluntary work for the Acli.
